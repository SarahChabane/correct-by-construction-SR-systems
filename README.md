# correct-by-construction-SR-systems


The present directory contains a tool for modelling Synchronous reactive systems and proof of 
correctness of the generated models. It includes three files : 

1. The file abstioa.ec contains abstract definitions of input/output automata. 

2. The file SRmodel.ec contains the definition of synchronous reactive models (SR-models), and 
the proof of correctness of SRmodels.

3. The file SRcomposition.ec contains the definition of composition of SR-models and proof of 
corretness of the composition.

The proof of correctness of synchronous reactive systems  is performed using Easycrypt tool.
